        <h2> Reach Out and Touch Someone</h2>
        <p> started out as a small venture, with Bell and his associates working to improve and refine 
            the telephone technology. But as the popularity of the telephone grew, so did the company, 
            which quickly became a major player in the emerging telecommunications industry.</p>

    <h3>The American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T)</h3>
    <p>in 1885 was established as a subsidiary of the Bell Telephone Company. Under the leadership of AT&T's first president, 
        Theodore Vail, the company worked to expand and improve the telephone network across the United States, using aggressive 
        marketing and investment strategies.<br>

        By the turn of the 20th century, the Bell Telephone Company and AT&T had become the dominant players in the
        telecommunications industry, controlling most of the telephone lines and networks in the United States.
        In 1913, the U.S. government filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company, arguing that its monopoly 
        was harming competition and innovation in the industry.<br>

        After years of legal battles, AT&T agreed to a settlement in 1982, which resulted in the breakup of the company 
        into several regional "Baby Bell" companies. Today, AT&T continues to operate as a major telecommunications 
        provider, offering a range of services including wireless, internet, and cable television.<br>
